# Key_Logger_Project

A basic keylogger tool developed in Python for educational and cybersecurity learning purposes. This project captures keyboard inputs and logs them into a file for monitoring user activity — useful for understanding how keylogging works, its ethical boundaries, and how to defend against such attacks.
